I am an incoming PhD student in the Statistics department at Columbia University. Previously, I completed B.A.s in Computer Science and Statistics at UC Berkeley where I fortunate to work with <a href='https://statistics.yale.edu/people/jas-sekhon'>Jasjeet Sekhon</a> and <a href='https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/chunleiliu.html'>Chunlei Liu</a>.

I am broadly interested in interpretable and causal machine learning in applied contexts.
